# Static analysis testing

**Process of verifying that your code meets certain expectations without actually running it.**

Static testing analyses aspects such as readability, consistency, error handling, type checking, and alignment with best practices.

**Testing checks if your code works or not, whereas static analysis checks if it is written well or not.**
